Tpying Speed Test

Created a basic typing speed test ap using Tkinter using python code.
It displays a UI that will ask you if you are ready? and will prompt you to press the start button!

Once the start button is pressed a timer of 60 seconds will begin to countdown to 0.
Text will be displayed while the timer is active for you to copy / rewrite as correctly as possible.
You will type/copy/rewrite the text displayed being displayed in the black box, in the provided entry 
field before the timer has reached 0!

Once the timer has reached 0, the entry field will be disabled and the user will be able to see their 
stats per minute and misspelt words.
